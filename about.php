                <h1>Hello!</h1> 
                <h3>Thank you for visiting my store!</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>I would like to tell you a little more about my journey and my creative process:</h4>
                <br>
                <p>In the last 10 yaers I have worked as a photographer and assistant director in the film industry. 
                   Nonetheless, in the past years I started to experiment with <strong>alternative photographic processes</strong>, like cyanotype, 
                   lumen print and image transfer.</p>
                <p>Plants and flowers can be immortalized by the sun in a deep blue thanks to the ancient process of cyanotype. 
                <strong>Wet cyanotype</strong> is an experimental photographic technique made by hand, in which objects and natural pigments 
                   are placed on (wet) paper with the cyanotype emulsion. The result is always uncertain and that is part of the 
                   beauty of this technique. The exposure to sunlight needed to get the frames can be just a few hours or even days.</p>
                <p>I also use <strong>image transfer techniques</strong> that allow me to place all or select areas of a photograph, 
                   illustration and drawing onto or next to existing images or cyanotypes in a seamless kind of <strong> collage.</strong> 
                <p>In this online store you can <strong><a href="login.php">purchase</a></strong> hand-made accesories, which will be sent to you in a matter of days.</p>
                <p>You can also book <strong>online individual or group workshops</strong> with me, in which I can tell you more about the 
                   research and experimentation I have made over the past years.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>I appreciate your interest in supporting my creative journey!</strong> </p>
