# Online store for @huella.luminosa

This is a project (work in progress) to learn more about PHP. 
The goal is to create an online store for an artist who wants to sell her hand-crafted accesories. 

The database holds information about the customers, such as name, email, phone number and address. 

It is still necessary to implement a payment functionality and enhance the overall design and UI/UX.
